## Knowledge Area  
A broad category or domain of related topics within a field of study that organizes and structures the foundational concepts, skills, and practices required for expertise in that field.  

### Examples:  
- Data Security  
- Software Security  
- Network Security  
- Human Security  
- Organizational Security  

---

## Domain of Study  
A specific area of focus that explores concepts, techniques, and practices to protect systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.  

### Examples:  
- Network Security  
- Cryptography  
- Application Security  
- Incident Response  
- Cloud Security  

---

## Topic  
A specific subject or sub-component within a Domain of Study that focuses on detailed aspects of knowledge and practice. Topics represent the building blocks for exploring and understanding specialized areas within a broader discipline.  

### Examples:  
- Basic concepts  
- Advanced concepts  
- Mathematical background  
- Historical ciphers  
- Symmetric (private key) ciphers  

---

## Concept  
A fundamental idea or building block of understanding embedded within a Topic.  

### Examples:  
- Encryption/decryption, sender authentication, data integrity, non-repudiation  
- Attack classification (ciphertext-only, known plaintext, chosen plaintext, chosen ciphertext)  

---

## Learning Outcomes (Competencies)  
Measurable skills, knowledge, and abilities that a learner is expected to acquire and demonstrate after studying within a specific Domain of Study.  

### Examples:  
- Explain the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.  
- Apply symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., RSA) to secure data.  
- Use hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
